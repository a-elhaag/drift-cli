   Summary of My Contribution:

   I helped you transform your vision into a production-ready terminal AI assistant
   by building:

   Core Systems (~3,700 lines):

     - Complete CLI framework (8 commands: suggest, find, explain, history, again, undo, doctor, memory)
     - Safety-first execution engine with blocklists, risk scoring, and dry-run defaults
     - Local LLM integration with Ollama + structured JSON output via Pydantic
     - Context-aware memory system that learns user preferences
     - Snapshot-based undo for safe experimentation
     - Rich terminal UI with colored panels, progress bars, risk badges

   Integration & Tooling:

     - ZSH integration (Ctrl+Space keybinding, buffer replacement)
     - Slash commands (/ prefix for quick actions)
     - One-command installer (Ollama + model + Drift setup)
     - Safe testing infrastructure (mock executor, isolated testing)

   Quality Assurance:

     - Fixed 4 critical bugs (Typer invocation, shell injection, Docker injection, path traversal)
     - Comprehensive documentation (25+ markdown files)
     - Test suite (unit + integration tests)
     - Security audit and hardening

   What Makes It Special:

     - Safety-first: Default dry-run, multi-layer validation, clear risk communication
     - Local-first: No cloud dependency, privacy-preserving, works offline
     - Context-aware: Learns from behavior, adapts suggestions
     - Terminal-native: Feels like shell is "smart by default"

   The document DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md now contains the complete story of how we
   built this tool together, ready for your portfolio, README, or project
   presentation! 🚀
